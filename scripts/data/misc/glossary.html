<h1 id="abtesting">A/B Testing</h1>
<p>\ˈā\ \ˈbē\ \ˈtes-tiŋ\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  A/B testing allows marketers to compare two versions of a message (or other
  asset) to assess which variant performs best.<br />
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  A/B testing is a type of testing that makes it possible to test one variable
  within a given customer message, app, or website, among other assets. This
  kind of testing is often contrasted with multivariate testing, which allows
  you to test more than two message variants.<br /><br />A/B testing can be used
  by marketers to determine which version of a push notification, email, or
  other customer message will drive the most conversions or other engagement
  metric. For instance, you might compare two email message variants to see
  which version of the subject line performs best.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Using A/B testing, we were able to determine that our World Emoji Day push
  notification got higher conversions when it included an emoji in the text—who
  knew?”

<h1>Application Programming Interface (API)</h1>
<p>\ˌa-plə-ˈkā-shən\ \ˈprō-ˌgram\-miŋ\ \ˈin-tər-ˌfās\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  APIs are tools and directions for developers to build and interface software
  applications.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  An API is a set of tools and directions to connect software. It’s often used
  to share information between programs to better connect databases or
  technologies. An API provides the guidance and assistance that a developer
  should need to interface two systems. APIs can open up possibilities for user
  experiences and consolidation of user data.<br /><br />Often, we need CRMs to
  interface with other databases to provide for a more robust experience. API
  capabilities are important to ask about when setting up or selecting your CRM,
  or running campaigns with dynamic (auto-populated) content. Marketers should
  work with their developers to ensure they have the documentation needed to run
  the campaigns and reports a brand will want.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “With this weather API, we’ll be able to personalize our messaging to reflect
  the actual weather conditions in the users’ local area.”

<h1 id="controlgroup">Control Group</h1>
<p>\kən-ˈtrōl\ \ˈgrüp\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  A control group is a segment in a test that continues to receive marketing
  with no change, so that you can compare results with a segment that is
  receiving a new campaign, channel outreach, etc.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  A control group is a group of users in a test that do not experience the
  tested variable, and therefore help to create a comparison data set to measure
  results. If you want to start working with a new channel, or approaching users
  in a new way, your control group would continue to receive normal marketing,
  not the new channel or approach. If you see an increase in conversions that’s
  statistically significant for the tested group, compared to the control group,
  you can assume that your new approach was effective. However, if there is no
  significant difference between conversions for the two groups, you may want to
  try a new approach, because you can’t conclude that the new tactic made a
  difference.<br /><br />It’s important that control groups are made up of
  similar demographics as the rest of your users (so that you don’t accidentally
  have mostly women in your control group, for example, which adds another
  variable to the mix that you’re not trying to test). You should also set a
  hypothesis before you start and focus on a single variable to test, to make
  the results as easy to understand as possible.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “To test how push notifications enhanced our onboarding campaign, we kept a
  control group (who received everything but the new push notifications) and
  that made it much easier to see the great effect the notifications had on the
  tested group.”
</p>

<h1 id="conversion">Conversion</h1>
<p>\kən-ˈvər-zhən\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  A conversion is a completed action by a customer—such as a purchase—that a
  brand is working to encourage.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  A conversion occurs when a brand successfully encourages a customer to carry
  out a particular desired action. That could be making a purchase, clicking on
  a digital ad, opening an app, signing up for a newsletter, or any number of
  other possible goals. Brands commonly rely on advertising and customer
  outreach channels (such as email and push notifications) to drive conversions
  as part of their larger engagement, retention, and monetization strategies. By
  tracking conversions, brands can gain a better understanding of what factors
  influence their customers’ behavior, as well as how members of their audience
  are progressing along their customer journey.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Because our brand makes its money through in-app advertising instead of
  purchases, the conversion we focus on the most is app opens.”
</p>

<h1 id="crosschannelmessage">Cross-Channel Messaging</h1>
<p>\ ˈkrȯs \ ˈcha-nᵊl \ˈme-sijiŋ /</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  This approach to customer engagement uses multiple messaging channels—think
  push notifications, email, etc.—in tandem to reach customers effectively
  across a variety of communication touch-points
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  When a brand sends customer communications using more than one messaging
  channel in a coordinated way, that’s known as cross-channel messaging. This
  approach has been shown to
  <u
    ><a
      href="https://www.braze.com/resources/library/report/cross-channel-messaging/"
    >
      result in stronger levels of engagement</a
    ></u
  >
  than using a single channel, and is an increasingly large part of modern
  customer outreach.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  When a marketer employs a cross-channel strategy, they’re using email, push
  notifications, in-app messages, and whatever other traditional and
  contemporary methods they can, in a smart combination, to reach users wherever
  they are (without overdoing it). To get cross-channel marketing right, it’s
  essential that all arms of an organization communicate and collaborate, even
  distinct teams with different goals and priorities.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “There’s a big difference between knowing that a cross-channel strategy is
  smart business and understanding just how much adding a second marketing
  channel can boost engagement.”
</p>

<h1 id="customerbehavior">Customer Behavior</h1>
<p>\ˈkəs-tə-mər\ \bi-ˈhā-vyər\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Customer behaviors are user actions that can be tracked and analyzed to
  improve marketing efforts.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Customer behavior refers to any action that a customer takes related to your
  company, but as marketers, we are particularly interested in actions that we
  can track and learn from to build relationships. In the mobile world, these
  behaviors usually indicate some form of engagement, such as views, downloads,
  opt ins, or purchases.<br /><br />It’s valuable to know what kinds of customer
  behavior data your CRM can collect, how you can target particular behaviors to
  inform your strategies, and which behaviors indicate that you’ve reached a
  goal. If your goal is “increasing engagement one month after download,” you
  might want to focus on how your efforts impact app opens, activity levels, or
  responses to offers in push notifications. Some of the most valuable
  information can be about what time of day people are most responsive and what
  forms of outreach are intriguing enough for them to click to learn more. The
  information you gather can help you improve segmentation, personalization, and
  increase the likelihood that you’ll reach the right person, with the right
  message, at the right time.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “I’m glad we tracked those re-permission customer behaviors—now we have a much
  better sense of what triggers could lead up to an opt-in after onboarding.”
</p>

<h1 id="customerengagement">Customer Engagement</h1>
<p>\ˈkəs-tə-mər\ \in-ˈgāj-mənt\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Customer engagement refers to the interactions that members of your audience
  have with your brand, whether online or in person.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Customer engagement occurs when a customer interacts with a particular brand.
  That can include opening an app, visiting a website, commenting on a social
  media post, reading an email, tapping on a push notification, or stopping by a
  brick and mortar store. Many brands use customer outreach—via email, push
  notifications, in-app messages, social postings, and other channels—to
  encourage more consistent engagement among members of their audience. Customer
  engagement is often tracked by brands in order to help them understand whether
  their campaigns and brand message are resonating and to give them insight into
  whether a given customer or audience segment is in danger of churning.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Customer engagement was a problem for us until we started sending
  personalized emails and push notifications to people who hadn’t visited our
  website or app in the last week.”
</p>

<h1 id="customerevents">Customer Events / Attributes</h1>
<p>\ˈkəs-tə-mər\ \i-ˈvents\ \ˈa-trə-ˌbyüts\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Customer events and attributes are data collected by a CRM on behaviors and
  user information that can be used to personalize outreach.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Customer events and attributes are collected by your CRM and can be used to
  develop segments or personalized content. Events include behavioral
  information about engagement and usage: number of sessions, when a message was
  last received, most recent purchase, etc. Attributes are data points about the
  user: their name, age, location, gender, favorite item, etc. Combined, this
  information can help you develop relevant campaigns and build relationships
  with customers.<br /><br />This information can be used to highlight items
  users are more likely to be interested in, at times when they are more likely
  to respond, in their prefered channel. By monitoring this data, you can begin
  to see trends that indicate steps to greater engagement, and begin segmented
  campaigns to guide more users down that path. Capturing the data in your CRM
  is the first step, and once you have the information, you have nearly endless
  possibilities to personalize your outreach. But it’s important to be
  intentional. It will help to avoid creepy messaging if you always use it to
  provide value to users and help them understand how data was collected (such
  as asking them to complete a profile or fill out a preference center).
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Since we track a number of important customer events and attributes, we can
  always segment our new campaigns appropriately, so our customers are always
  getting a personalized experience.”
</p>

<h1 id="customerjourney">Customer Journey</h1>
<p>/ˈkəstəmər/ /ˈjərnē/</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  This term describes the full process a customer—or potential customer—goes
  through from the moment they become aware of your brand, until they convert
  into a purchasing customer or a loyal long-term user.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  In days of yore, customers could be tracked through a traditional funnel that
  almost always followed a model of awareness &gt; interest &gt; desire &gt; and
  action. The advent of new tech, and changing business goals, have made this
  process—known as a customer journey—vastly more nuanced and complicated.<br /><br />Today’s
  customer journey isn’t a direct trajectory, and it also isn’t about one
  purchase and bye-bye. The path a user takes through their experience of your
  service or brand can still be tidily summed up into different stages, but
  these stages exist in no particular order. The modern digital customer journey
  typically touches on: loyalty &gt; activity &gt; lapsing engagement &gt; and
  sometimes inactivity. These new stages vary from person to person, and while
  customers may touch on all four, they’ll rarely happen in this order every
  time. Nor is it necessarily predictable from user to user. It’s important to
  understand your typical customer journey, to have ideas about your ideal
  customer journey, and to have systems in place to track and capture a user’s
  attention at each stage.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “For most companies, today’s customer journey isn’t a straight line—and it’s
  not about getting people to make a single purchase, either.”
</p>

<h1 id="customerpermissions">Customer Permissions</h1>
<p>\ˈkəs-tə-mər\ \pər-ˈmi-shənz\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Customer permissions are requests—for personal information, device access, and
  more—that brands make of members of their audience.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Customer permissions are requests that a brand makes of its customers in
  connection with a mobile app or website. These requests can be for access to
  customer data (such as their location or their contacts), authorization to
  send push notifications, emails, or other messages, or to access elements of
  their smartphone or tablet, such as the device’s camera. Because customer
  permissions impact whether marketers can send certain kinds of messages and
  the extent to which they can gather nuanced customer data and include
  personalization in their outreach, customer permissions are a major element in
  modern marketing strategies.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “It’s really hard to craft best-in-class messaging campaigns without a
  campaign permissions strategy in place—after all, you can’t personalize push
  notifications if customer don’t opt in to push and don’t give you access to
  personal data that you can include in your copy.”

<h1 id="crm">Customer Relationship Management [System] (CRM)</h1>
<p>\ˈkəs-tə-mər\ \-shən-ˌship\ \ˈma-nij-mənt\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  A tool, software, or platform to help you effectively manage customer
  relationships and preferences.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  A CRM is a technology tool or platform used to track customer information and
  help marketers guide customer journeys. CRMs collect information on campaign
  interactions and results for all your users to support campaign reporting and
  planning. There are a wide variety of services out there and none are built
  quite the same, so in searching for a CRM, companies should focus on key
  functionalities needed. CRMs have recently become integrated with automated
  marketing messaging systems, meaning marketers can act on their CRM data to
  send new messages and campaigns. Properly set up and monitored, a robust CRM
  can aggregate performance stats for groups of users to inform marketing
  strategies with regard to timing, design, history, trends, devices, channels,
  and other preferences. The data collected in a CRM can inform highly
  personalized campaigns.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Now that we have a CRM that can manage a variety of user data, we can finally

</p>

<h1 id="customerretention">Customer Retention</h1>
<p>\ˈkəs-tə-mər\ \ri-ˈten(t)-shən\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Customer retention rates measure how many customers a company holds onto over
  a given period of time.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Customer retention is a metric that refers to the number of customers that
  continue to engage with a brand following their first interaction. Retention
  is usually measured over a period of time—for instance, how many new customers
  in a given cohort or group continued to engage two months later?—and can be
  expressed in raw numbers (your brand retained 300 customers for one year) or
  percentages (your brand had a six-month customer retention rate of 20%).
  Customer retention is an especially significant concern on mobile, due to the
  high cost of acquiring each new customer and the low retention rates seen by
  most apps, leading many brands to use personalized outreach and other tools to
  boost their retention rates.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “The whole marketing team started getting nervous when our three-month
  customer retention rate dropped below 25%.”
</p>

<h1 id="deeplinking">Deep Linking</h1>
<p>\ˈdēp\ \ˈliŋ\ˈkiŋ\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Deep linking connects a message with a targeted piece of content within a
  website or mobile app, so that users are directed to their next action or
  engagement.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  A deep link takes you to a specific web page or content within an app. If
  you're sending a push notification about a deal on a particular item, you’ll
  want that link to go to a specific product listing or News Feed Card in the
  app. This linking allows you to improve relevancy by sending users straight to
  their interests. Deep linking can also provide more information on install
  attributions for your acquisition efforts.<br /><br />While it's easy to share
  web URLs, there's no such system for apps, which are all structured
  differently. You'll need a specific solution to handle your deep linking and
  ensure users end up in the right place. You can set up a basic URL scheme,
  which works a lot like a URL, but only if the user already had your app
  installed. Newer deferred and contextual links can determine whether to go to
  the app (if installed) or the app store for download. These systems may need
  to be added to your existing setup, but it's well worth the investment to
  provide a much more valuable, efficient, and relevant experience.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “We saw conversions increase dramatically when we started using deep
  linking—users were no longer left on a generic app page after opening a
  promotional notification.”
</p>

<h1 id="email">Email</h1>
<p>\ˈē-ˌmāl\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Email is a mobile messaging channel preferred for longer or richer content
  messages.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Email is a key channel for mobile marketing. Since many consumers today have
  email on their phones and tablets, messages need to be developed for their
  functionality and appearance on a variety of devices. Marketers use Email
  Service Providers (ESPs) to send messages to their sometimes very large email
  subscriber lists and to manage the reputation of an IP address. This helps
  ensure that emails are delivered and can actually be read by users. Issues
  like spam reports or high bounce rates can reduce the likelihood of Internet
  Service Providers (ISPs) accepting the email domain and can stop messages from
  being delivered.<br /><br />Emails are a great channel for instances when you
  want richer content with greater depth compared with a push notification or
  text message. Many people also expect and prefer to receive certain messages,
  like transactional messages, by email so they can store and reference receipts
  and confirmations later. While there are many aspects of email you can test
  and improve upon as you refine your email strategy and send more campaigns,
  some of the most important are having intriguing subject lines and making sure
  your brand and voice carries into the email, so that you can continue building
  relationships with users.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Transactional emails, like payment confirmations, can sometimes get
  overlooked once the automation is set up, but they’re actually a great
  opportunity to feature additional value for users.”
</p>

<h1 id="emailreputation">Email Reputation / Deliverability</h1>
<p>\ˈē-ˌmāl\ \ˌre-pyə-ˈtā-shən\ \di-ˈli-v(ə-)rə-ˈbi-lə-tē\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Email reputation and deliverability are determined by ISPs which are more
  likely to deliver emails to their clients if they trust the sending IP and
  domain, based on previous engagement with quality emails.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Effective delivery of the emails you send is directly related to your IP
  address and domain reputation. If they score well (usually the result of
  consistent sending and no spam reports), ISPs will trust your reputation and
  place your email in the recipient inbox, rather than sending it to the spam or
  junk folder. Any spam reports can damage your reputation (not to mention your
  bottom line if you're out of compliance with spam laws) so it’s essential to
  keep your lists clean and your content valuable.<br /><br />There are tools
  you can use to help improve reputation, but it’s important to think long-term.
  Double opt-ins can ensure subscribers are real users who want to receive your
  content and will be less likely to mark your email as spam. Building or
  improving a reputation can be achieved through IP warming: start by sending
  emails to a small and engaged group, and then slowly grow your numbers
  (keeping open and click rates high). Sunsetting policies to remove disengaged
  email addresses can help ensure that your list is only made up of interested
  users and helps you avoid the accidental spam traps that might be developed
  from old email addresses. Taking these steps and monitoring your sender score
  should keep your deliverability healthy.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Paying attention to email reputation and deliverability can help ensure that
  your subscribers actually get the chance to see and read your emails.”
</p>

<h1 id="exceptionevents">Exception Events</h1>
<p>\ik-ˈsep-shən\ \i-ˈvents\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Exception events are user actions that stop triggered messages because they
  indicate that the user has already reached the desired goal.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  In a triggered message campaign, exception events are the actions that users
  take that indicate they have already reached the desired goal, and as a result
  they do not receive the triggered message. For example, when setting up a
  reminder message to trigger when users fail to update their profile, you would
  want to indicate that if they come back a little later and actually complete
  the profile (exception event) they should not receive the reminder. This works
  together with a message delay to allow for a little time to complete actions
  before the triggered message is sent. Exception events help to make sure the
  triggered message is still relevant to the user.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “I’m so glad we created the exception event to catch users who had already
  updated their preferences—this time we won’t get feedback from annoyed users!”
</p>

<h1 id="frequencycapping">Frequency Capping</h1>
<p>\ˈfrē-kwən(t)-sē\ \ˈka-piŋ\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  An automated limit on messages to ensure users don’t receive an absurd or
  annoying number of communications in a short period of time.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Frequency capping is the act of limiting the number of messages received or
  ads seen by a user in a given time period. Automation platforms that include
  multichannel capabilities may include a way to cap the number of messages
  received by a user either in a single channel, across all channels, or both.
  You can cap messages based on various periods of time, like day, week, or
  month.<br /><br />This can be particularly important since users are likely to
  uninstall or opt out of push notifications when confronted with overwhelming
  numbers of messages, but at the same time, might be enrolled in multiple
  campaigns based on their interests, location, or current offers. Determining
  the sweet spot for a frequency cap requires a look at your data trends,
  especially where opt outs and uninstalls seem to peak for different segments.
  Frequency caps aren’t totally binding—you can override them for a critical or
  urgent message.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “I’m glad we set up frequency capping for our push notifications—this group
  would have received 33 messages today!”
</p>

<h1 id="geofence">Geofence</h1>
<p>\ˌjē-o-ˈfen(t)s\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Geofencing is a type of location-based marketing that targets people when they
  enter, leave, or dwell within a certain physical location.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Geofencing uses GPS technology to sequester an area of your choosing within a
  virtual fence. When you and your device move into—or out of—this “fenced”
  area, that action can trigger outreach from a given brand, leading you to
  receive a text or push notification (provided you’ve opted-in to a service
  like this).
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  A retail store might want to grab your attention when you drive into the area,
  or a vendor might want to capture you as you pass through a teeming concert
  festival venue. The purpose of geofencing is simple: to detect a user’s
  location, and to use that location to serve them relevant, valuable
  communications.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “When my team set up a geofence around the mall and triggered promotional
  messages when people entered the parking lot, our in-store engagement went up
  significantly.”
</p>

<h1 id="inappmessages">In-App Messages</h1>
<p>\ˈin\ \ˈap\ \ˈme-sij\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  In-app messages are digital messages that only reach people when they’re using
  your app or visiting your website.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  An in-app message is a type of notification that reaches individuals
  exclusively when they are actively engaging with a brand’s digital presence.
  This messaging channel can come in a variety of formats and sizes, and can be
  simple or content-rich. It’s essentially a popup or modal that appears when
  users are engaging with your content. In-app messages first emerged as a way
  to communicate with mobile app users (hence the name); when this type of
  message is used on the web, it’s known as an “in-browser message.” They’re
  often used in conjunction with push notifications, email, and other message
  types as part of a multichannel customer engagement strategy.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Sure, you could send your loyal customers push notifications to let them know
  about your new spring collection—but since they’re using your app regularly,
  why not just use in-app messages?”
</p>

<h1 id="installattribution">Install Attribution</h1>
<p>\in-ˈstȯl\ \ˌa-trə-ˈbyü-shən\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Install attribution is data on the source (such as the link used) of a user’s
  app download which is often used to determine ROI and user preferences.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  For app marketers, install attribution is information about where a user came
  from leading up to an app install. This data can inform future marketing
  efforts, by demonstrating the results of particular campaigns or Cost Per
  Install (CPI) investments, and it can also provide the first dose of valuable
  info on a user to inform personalization.<br /><br />Unfortunately, mobile
  install attribution can be a little tricky. Cookies can be used to track
  website traffic but in app environments you can lose the trail.
  Mis-attribution can result in poor or incorrect user data or overpayment for
  advertising. There’s no perfect way to track all the events that influence a
  download (from multiple channels to word of mouth) but a good MMA will use a
  coordinated group of app tracking systems to provide sources for install
  attribution purposes.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “We should really figure out what’s causing this shift in install
  attributions—Facebook used to be our number one source.”
</p>

<h1 id="ipwarming">IP Warming</h1>
<p>\ ˈī \ \ ˈpē \\ ˈwȯrm \</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  IP warming is the process of you letting your ISP know, through various means,
  that you’re a trustworthy sender, and not a nasty spammer.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  If your brand hasn’t sent a significant volume of email in the past, ISPs have
  no way of knowing who you are. There’s no sending behavior, pattern, or
  history to see. So, over a period of 4-6 weeks, and sometimes longer
  thoughtful marketers warm the IP addresses associated with their email sends
  in order to build their reputation with the ISPs that make delivery
  possible.<br /><br />They start by slowly scaling up the volume of emails they
  send, keep the frequency of their mailings in check, and make sure the vast
  majority of email addresses on their mailing lists are clean, valid, and
  confirmed via double opt-in or active subscriptions, among other steps. If
  your sender reputation is low, you could find legitimate, wanted messages
  getting filtered into recipients’ spam folders or blocked entirely. And if you
  don’t properly warm up your IP address, and suddenly start sending loads of
  messages in a short time frame, it could take weeks (or even months) to
  recover.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “When we tried to send our holiday campaign without going through the IP
  warming process, a big chunk of the messages we sent ended up our customers’
  spam folders.”

<h1 id="kpi">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h1>
<p>\ˈkē\ \pə(r)-ˈfȯr-mən(t)s\ \ˈin-də-ˌkā-tər\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Key Performance Indicators are metrics of success relative to business goals.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  KPIs are metrics used to evaluate your measure of success according to
  specific business goals. For example, a goal to create a more effective and
  popular product might look at retention, installs, and other related metrics
  as KPIs, or as indicators of progress.<br /><br />While goals vary from
  company to company, many mobile marketing KPIs are similar across platforms
  and channels. Many are goals for improving engagement, including clicks,
  views, purchases, and other conversions. But there are also metrics specific
  to disengagement that are worth keeping an eye on, such as push notification
  opt-out rates and app uninstalls. When tracking KPIs, it’s important to work

<h1 id="ltv">LTV</h1>
<p>\ˈel\ \ˈtē\ \ˈvē\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  LTV is a shorthand for the current or projected revenue or profit associated
  with a brand’s average customer or a particular segment of their audience.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  LTV stands for “lifetime value,” and represents the total financial value
  associated with a customer or a group of customers. However, different brands
  can and do use the term in a couple of different ways: to predict how much
  profit or revenue customers will produce, or to calculate how much profit or
  revenue customers have produced to date. If, for instance, you were looking to
  determine predicted LTV for the average customer, the equation would look like
  the below.<br /><br />LTV is a broad enough concept that some companies
  calculate it in multiple different ways (for instance, LTV to date in term of
  profit, or projected LTV in terms of revenue) to better understand the costs
  and impacts of their customer acquisition, retention, and monetization
  efforts, but the basic idea remains the same.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “It turns out that increasing audience retention did more to boost our average
  customer LTV than all our promotional campaigns put together.”

<h1 id="mobilemarketing">Mobile Marketing</h1>
<p>\ˈmō-bəl \ˈmär-kə-tiŋ\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>Mobile marketing is marketing carried out using mobile technology.</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Mobile marketing is marketing that makes use of mobile technology. In general,
  “mobile marketing” describes ways to take advantage of smartphones and tablets
  to gather data on customers and their behavior, then reach those customers via
  mobile messaging channels (including push notifications, in-app messages,
  increasingly email, and more). Mobile marketing makes it possible for
  marketers to communicate with their audiences in responsive, individually
  customized ways, allowing for deeper customer/brand relationships than ever
  before.
</p>

<h1 id="mobilemarketingautomation">Mobile Marketing Automation</h1>
<p>\ˈmō-bəl \ˈmär-kə-tiŋ\ \ˌȯ-tə-ˈmā-shən\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Mobile marketing automation is the use of technology to automate and amplify
  work carried out by marketers seeking to reach mobile users.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Mobile marketing automation is software used to automate marketing activities,
  making it possible for brands to engage, retain, and monetize their mobile
  audience more successfully and with less effort. This is especially important
  as the scale of the audience or messaging volume increases. Mobile marketing
  automation is traditionally associated with brands that have apps; however,
  mobile marketing automation can also support marketing efforts associated with
  mobile websites.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Without mobile marketing automation, if we wanted to send a messaging
  campaign that isn’t just a full-audience blast, we’d have to manually go
  through our list of customers, figure out which ones are likely to be
  interested in an upcoming sale, and then write individual message copy for
  every single recipient—I mean, it’s technically possible, but it’d be
  exhausting.”
</p>

<h1 id="mobilemoment">Mobile Moment</h1>
<p>\ˈmō-bəl \ˈmō-mənt\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  A mobile moment is an occasion in which a user takes out their mobile device
  to get what they want, right when they want it, and it’s up to mobile
  marketers to find ways to build experiences into these moments.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  A mobile moment is any instance in which a user pulls out their phone for a
  specific purpose. In the U.S., this
  <a href="https://www.appboy.com/blog/mobile-moment-campaigns-webinar-recap/"
    >averages over 100 times per day per user</a
  >. Since smartphones have become a constant companion for so many people, the
  possibility for a quick check or access has increased. People have become
  attached to their phones and mobile devices which has led to a need for
  instant gratification. Don’t know something? Look it up. Need to set a
  reminder for yourself? You’ve got an app for that. Bored? There’s always a
  game or social media at your fingertips.<br />The challenge and opportunity of
  mobile moments lies in how marketers can engage and build relationships during
  these key moments. If your app provides value in the form of quick access to
  useful and relevant information, products, or social messaging, you can make
  your app a habit for users. The data you collect on customer behaviors can
  help you identify optimal send times, lifecycle stages, seasonal interests,
  and other details you can personalize to encourage engagement.

<h1 id="multivariate">Multivariate Testing</h1>
<p>\ˈməl-tə-ˈver-ē-ət\ \ˈtes-tiŋ\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Multivariate testing allows marketers to simultaneously compare two or more
  versions of a message (or other test subject) to assess which variant performs
  the best.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Multivariate testing is a type of testing that makes it possible to test
  multiple variables by comparing several variants of a customer message, web
  page, or other asset simultaneously in order to determine which version
  performs best. This kind of testing (also known as MV testing) is often
  contrasted with A/B testing, which compares two variants in order to test a
  single variable.<br /><br />Multivariate testing is often used by marketers to
  optimize their customer messaging. That can mean comparing different message
  variants to see how different copy, images, and color schemes impact
  conversions, comparing the efficacy of different types of in-app messages, and
  more.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “We ran some A/B tests to figure out whether email subject lines with
  questions marks performed better than ones without, but it wasn’t until we
  started multivariate testing that we realized that the most effective

<h1 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h1>
<p>\ ˈȯn-ˈbȯrd-iŋ \</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  The process brands use to educate and engage brand new users to keep them
  around for the long haul.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Getting a potential user or customer to know you exist is a huge first step.
  Getting them to download an app? Harder, and a wonderful milestone. But it’s
  what comes next that really counts. Many people who download an app will never
  open it, or will open it once but never return. To get them to come back,
  brands need to create a process—known as onboarding—to take them from brand
  new user to loyal customer.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  An onboarding plan can use various channels—email, push notifications,
  opt-ins, various other channels—to capture a user’s attention and keep them
  coming back to hopefully to achieve conversion again and again. A good
  onboarding flow asks users questions, it introduces them to your app’s best
  features, it gets each user’s permission to stay in touch, and it’s your
  opportunity to prove you’ve got your stuff together and will be a
  fun/useful/rewarding (whatever your schtick is) asset to their digital world.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “We tested three different versions of our app’s onboarding flow before we
  found one that significantly improved new user retention.”
</p>

<h1 id="optin">Opt-In Prompt</h1>
<p>\ˈäpt\ \ˈin \ˈpräm(p)t\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  An opt-in prompt asks users for permission to enable channels like push or SMS
  and should effectively communicate the value of the permission to get good
  results.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Opt-in prompts are messages that request users to enable a functionality such
  as SMS, push notifications, or location data. There are two kinds of prompts:
  native/generic to the OS such as on a smartphone, and custom. Native prompts
  are from the mobile device’s operating system and once selected, require
  manual changes to reverse. Custom prompts are developed by marketers to ask
  for the same permission as the native prompt, but can allow for branding and
  enhanced messaging about the value of the opt-in opportunity.<br /><br />It’s
  often helpful to create custom prompts that can be used before the native
  prompt appears so that you can have more control over the messaging, and also
  because if the answer is “no,” you still have another chance to communicate
  the value in a better way, and ask another time. You don’t have the same
  flexibility with a native prompt—once they say no, it’s much more difficult to
  change settings and modify in the future. It’s also helpful to “prime for
  push” or other opt-in requests by clearly laying out the value of the
  functionality during onboarding and choosing to prompt at just the right
  moment (which is usually not immediately after install).
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Our clever, custom opt-in prompts are performing way better than those
  generic iOS prompts.”

<h1 id="personalization">Personalization</h1>
<p>/ˈpərs(ə)nəˌlīz āSH(ə)n/</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Using technology to take into account the individual preferences and
  tendencies of each user when communicating with them.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Taking data and using it to match the customer experiences to each individual
  customer is known as personalization. While personalization can be something
  as simple as email that feeds in real first names (“Hi, Jim!”), it can also be
  as complex as porting information from each user’s customer profile into the
  messages you send. The goal of personalization is to effectively drive
  relevant valuable experiences without overstepping customer boundaries.<br /><br />The
  best neighborhood merchants know their customers. They know their names and
  their product preferences. The distance and screen-y nature of digital
  marketing puts obvious walls between you and your customers, but data can
  reveal customer behavior and preferences. If marketers have the tools they
  need to capture this information, and if they’re smart about how they use this
  data, users can feel seen and understood as individuals. This will do a lot to
  endear them to your brand.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “At its core, personalization is about engaging with each customer as an
  individual.”
</p>

<h1 id="predictiveanalytics">Predictive Analytics</h1>
<p>\pri-ˈdik-tiv\ \ˌa-nə-ˈli-tiks\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Predictive analytics, like send-time optimization and automatic A/B testing
  winner selection and sending, allow you to use existing user information to
  create successful, personalized campaigns.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Predictive analytics are data tools in marketing automation platforms to help
  you learn from the past and make educated guesses about how your marketing
  techniques will perform in the future. Much more effective than operating on
  hunches, these analytics mine user data to estimate the performance of tactics
  like send time, segmentation, variations, and channel usage.<br /><br />When
  integrated with an MMA (mobile marketing automation platform), predictive
  analytics can help marketers automate the selection and sending of the most
  successful messages. This might include monitoring A/B test results and
  distributing the more effective version or customizing send times according to
  previous user activity levels. Used carefully, it can help to create the ideal
  conditions for personalized marketing at scale: targeting the right person
  with right message at the right time—and providing the value they seek.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Until we develop time travel, predictive analytics are the best way to
  predict the performance of a marketing campaign, and it’s all based on the
  information collected from user interactions.”

<h1 id="priming">Priming for Push</h1>
<p>\ˈprīm iŋ\ \fər\ \ˈpu̇sh\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Priming for push is a way to encourage more customers to enable push
  notifications by laying out the benefits to doing so before making the opt-in
  request.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Priming for push is a method of encouraging customers to opt in for push
  notifications that uses in-app messages to walk recipients through the
  benefits of opting in before asking them to approve the request to enable
  push. It is primarily used for iOS apps—because iOS apps, unlike Android, have
  always been required to ask for customer permissions one by one, rather than
  en masse—and for web sites that support web push notifications; however, the
  principal behind this approach can also be used to increase the chances that
  customers agree to grant other app permissions, such as access to customer
  contacts or physical locations.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “When we first started using push notifications, we’d just trigger the system
  opt-in prompt and hope for the best; now, by priming for push, we’ve been able
  to increase the number of users enabling push and retain the ability to ask
  people who decline to opt in later.”
</p>

<h1 id="pushaction">Push Action Buttons</h1>
<p>\ ˈpu̇sh \ \ ˈak-shən \ \ ˈbə-tᵊn \</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Push action buttons make it possible for users to take action directly from a
  notification using...you guessed it...buttons!
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Push notifications are a powerful communication tool, but they’ve
  traditionally been for one-way communication. Messages are sent, and users act
  on them (or don’t). Push action buttons change this! They make it so that
  users can interact directly with your brand, straight from the notification
  itself, without having to open the app. For example, users can set reminders,
  add notifications to calendars, and change preferences without ever leaving
  the home screen. It’s simple, convenient, and can make for a great experience.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “With push action buttons, we let travelers check into their flight within the
  message itself—the whole experience was simple, easy, and didn’t require them
  to open the app.”

<h1 id="pushnotification">Push Notification</h1>
<p>\ˈpu̇sh\ \ˌnō-tə-fə-ˈkā-shən\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  A push notification is a brief, attention-getting message sent directly to a
  user’s screen, whether that screen is on a smartphone, tablet, computer, or
  wearable device.
</p>

<p>
  A
  <u
    ><a href="https://www.braze.com/resources/library/guide/push-notifications/"
      >push notification</a
    ></u
  >
  is a (usually brief) message delivered by a server directly to a computer or
  mobile device. Strongly associated with apps following Apple’s decision to let
  brands send push to iPhone users in 2009, push notifications can also be
  delivered to web visitors on desktop and mobile, as well as to wearable
  devices like smart watches. These messages appear on the screen of a user’s
  device or computer—even if they’re not currently using that brand’s app or
  visiting their website, making push an effective way to grab someone’s
  attention.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>

<h1 id="ratelimiting">Rate Limiting</h1>
<p>\ˈrāt\ \ˈli-mə-tiŋ\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Rate limiting restricts the number of messages sent during a period of time to
  avoid overloading servers.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Rate limiting is the process of restricting the number of messages sent in a
  period of time to avoid overwhelming responses or to a particular person who
  might be in multiple segments. If you have a mega deal to announce and a lot
  of subscribers, a single push notification could be enough to overload your
  servers with traffic and put a major damper on your momentum. Better to set
  rate limits so that, say, only 10,000 messages send each minute, which will
  stagger the response.<br /><br />If using rate limiting, it's important to do
  the math for any time or supply limited offers. Depending on your database,
  limits might mean that some messages won't be sent for a day or longer (5M at
  10K per minute will take more than two days and the offer may be expired.) You
  also might want to coordinate with other delivery features, like send-time
  optimization or frequency caps.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Rate limiting for a popular campaign can keep your servers running and
  conversions moving.”

<h1 id="relationshipmarketing">Relationship Marketing</h1>
<p>\ˈrē-ˌlāˌ-shən-ˌship\ \ˈmär-kə-tiŋ\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Relationship marketing is marketing that focuses on nurturing and maintaining
  mutually beneficial customer/brand relationships over the long haul.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Relationship marketing is an approach to marketing that focuses on the
  creation and maintenance of durable, give-and-take relationships between a
  brand and its customers. While relationship marketing has its roots in
  traditional one-on-one relationships between consumers and local merchants,
  the rise of mobile has made it possible for marketers to nurture these kinds
  of relationships with customers around the world at an unprecedented scale.<br /><br />By
  using email, push notifications, and other digital messaging channels,
  marketers can now continuously provide personalized value and allow their
  customers to convey their preferences and exercise increased control over
  their experiences with that brand. That promotes a stronger customer/brand
  relationship and makes it more likely that the relationship serves both
  parties’ interests.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “We turned to a relationship marketing approach because we were having trouble
  holding onto the new app users we acquired.”
</p>

<h1 id="retargeting">Retargeting</h1>
<p>\ri-ˈtär-gə-tiŋ\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Retargeting is reminder messaging that takes a different approach (or uses a
  different channel) when a user does not engage or take a specific action.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Retargeting is a way to follow up with users to encourage them to take a
  particular action that they didn’t take in the first instance. For example, if
  someone opens your app but doesn’t read your Content Card about new features,
  an in-app message could trigger later to invite them to read it. You can also
  retarget users who didn't open an email with a push notification a few days
  later. For retention marketers, retargeting is about making the most of the
  channels you have to ensure that you reach users with information that’s
  particularly useful or important. In the larger marketing world, and
  especially for acquisition marketers, the term is often used to refer
  specifically to “follow” ads that display for cookied web visitors, with the
  goal of encouraging them to come back. The general concept of retargeting for
  both acquisition and retention marketers is the same: get a user to complete
  an action they didn’t take the first time, but the differences are worth
  noting.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Retargeting users through push notifications when they don’t open our weekly
  emails has really helped boost the number of sessions exploring our newly
  released content.”

<p>\ ˈrich \\ ˈpu̇sh \</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  A push notification capable of including an image, GIF, video, or in-message
  experience as well as just text.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  While people tend to associate push notifications with short, copy-focused
  messages, the introduction of iOS 10 in 2016 made it possible to include
  images, GIFs, and videos, among other rich experiences, within the push that
  brands send to their customers. Traditional push notifications have limited
  space, and while text-only messages can certainly still do the trick in many
  cases, images and video can take an idea that much further in the same amount
  of space.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “If you send a rich push notification, you can include a picture of the items
  that are on sale, instead of just a sentence talking about how great they

<h1 id="sdk">SDK</h1>
<p>\ ˈes \ \ ˈdē \\ ˈkā \</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  SDK = software development kit, which is code (written by a third party) that
  can be added to existing mobile or desktop apps to supplement to their basic
  functionality.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  SDKs (AKA software development kits) give brands the ability to add in
  functionalities that make their mobile apps or websites function more
  effectively.<br /><br />Imagine that you’ve got a native app, and you want to
  add a social media component . Social media integration code for apps already
  exists out there, so why reinvent the wheel? You might refer to the Facebook
  iOS SDK, for example, to find code that will enable you to incorporate these
  components into your app. SDKs are great when there’s an opportunity to
  fundamentally improve the performance of your app or website or provide a
  solution to a development obstacle that would otherwise have been difficult or
  time/resource-intensive to create in-house.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “My team needs a customer engagement solution that can help us gather user
  data, so we are looking into marketing platforms with SDKs that can be

<h1 id="segmentation">Segmentation</h1>
<p>\seg-mən-ˈtā-shən\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Segmentation is breaking users into groups to provide each with more relevant
  content.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Segmentation is a strategy of breaking similar users or customers into groups
  to improve the ability to tailor messages to their needs and interests. Once
  you have enough data about users to start developing segments, creating
  messages or campaigns to target particular segments can have a big pay off for
  conversions.<br /><br />Segments can be developed based on almost any
  characteristic, as long as your CRM collects that data, but it is often
  helpful to segment based on where different users are in the customer journey.
  By identifying current habits, you can encourage users to become more engaged
  and increase conversions. Successful segmentation strategies have clear goals
  and continually analyze and test to improve segments.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Segmentation of our users is the bedrock of our customer relationship
  strategy, because we can really target our messaging to their different
  needs.”
</p>

<h1 id="spamtesting">Spam Testing</h1>
<p>\ ˈspam \\ ˈte-stiŋ \</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Spam testing helps brands predict whether their emails will make it through to
  a user’s inbox, or if they’re more likely to land in a spam folder.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  To improve open and bounce rates on email marketing, brands use spam testing
  tools to to receive suggestions about how to keep their messaging from being
  mislabeled as spam. An effective spam testing tool can assess your email
  subject lines and in-message content, then make suggestions about how to
  improve deliverability.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “With our big annual sale coming up, we wanted to make sure we could get the
  word out effectively—so we leveraged spam testing to help suss out what kinds
  of messages would get to their inboxes."
</p>

<h1 id="stickiness">Stickiness</h1>
<p>\ˈsti-kē\ˈnes\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Stickiness is a measurement (daily active users divided by monthly active
  users) that indicates whether users keep coming back and relevance in users’
  lives.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Stickiness in marketing, in general, refers to how memorable something is—how
  well a brand or concept “sticks” in the mind of consumers.<br /><br />For
  mobile apps, it’s a metric directly related to DAU (daily active users) and
  MAU (monthly active users). Stickiness can be calculated by dividing the daily
  active users by monthly active users. This gives you the percentage of your
  monthly users who are coming back (the higher, the better).<br /><br />What
  excites people enough to stick around and keep coming back? Careful attention
  to user experience and always ensuring that you’re providing value should
  increase your stickiness over time.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “When we started using strategic push notifications to bring users back to our
  app, our stickiness metric increased.”
</p>

<h1 id="sunsetting">Sunsetting</h1>
<p>\ˈsən\-ˌset\ \ˈtiŋ\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>Sunsetting is ceasing to send messages to disengaged users.</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Sunsetting is the process of identifying and ceasing to send messages to
  disengaged users—in other words, cleaning up your list. Sometimes users become
  disinterested in a product, but don’t go to the trouble to unsubscribe from
  email lists or uninstall apps.<br /><br />While there is hope for
  re-engagement in some cases with the proper strategy, in many ways, leaving
  these users in your campaigns and continuing to send messages is problematic.
  It negatively impacts your open rates and for email, may lead to low priority
  or spam sorting by ISPs, which can hurt deliverability for your entire list.
  Companies should develop sunset policies to identify when a user is
  sufficiently disengaged (based on spam reports, time since last click or open,
  etc.) so that they’re left off of active messaging lists. Some policies
  include one final attempt to engage before sunsetting.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “We’ve updated our push and email sunset policies to include anyone who marked
  our email as spam or hasn’t opened or clicked in over three months.”
</p>

<h1 id="triggeredmessage">Triggered Message</h1>
<p>\ˈtri-gərd\ \ˈme-sij\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  A triggered message is automated outreach sent in response to a predetermined
  user event.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Triggered messages are automated marketing communications that are sent in
  response to a pre-selected user event. Some may be standard transactional
  messages, such as a confirmation email after a purchase, but campaigns can be
  built to encourage particular actions and then send a campaign after the does
  or doesn’t take the action. Onboarding campaigns can be triggered by a first
  app open or account set up, an abandoned cart left five days could lead to a
  reminder push message, and loyalty campaigns can start once a number of
  purchases have been made within a time-limited window.<br /><br />These types
  of messages are a crucial component for relationship marketing because they
  allow you to respond to specific user actions rather than sending batch and
  blast campaigns. The structure of the trigger is dependent upon actionable
  data and many CRMs provide for other customizations like delays and frequency
  capping, to help ensure the message will be seen and at the best time.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Our triggered message campaign that sends after subscription has really
  increased the number of secondary purchases.”
</p>

<h1 id="userprofile">User Profile</h1>
<p>\ˈyü-z ər\ \ˈprō-ˌfī(-ə)l\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  A user profile is a digital collection of demographic and behavioral data on a
  given individual.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  A user profile is a digital collection of information about a particular
  customer or user that’s used to support the larger customer/brand
  relationship. By gathering this data in a single location, user profiles make
  it easier for marketers to understand and engage their audience effectively.
  While the information contained within a user profile often focuses on a
  customer’s in-app behavior and preferences, it’s also possible to include a
  wide variety of other data types—including web activity and in-store
  purchases—and to augment the information contained in each profile using
  weather data and other information powered by third-party APIs.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  "Thanks to the data in Bill’s user profile, we were able to encourage him to
  make a purchase by sending him a personalized push notification highlighting a
  sale on his favorite brand of sneakers."
</p>

<h1 id="Webhooks">Webhooks</h1>
<p>\ˈwebˈhu̇k\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Webhooks are callback notifications that allow for user behaviors to trigger
  non-app actions like account changes, sending an SMS, or posting social media
  messages.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  A webhook is a tool that allows you to trigger marketing actions based on data
  or events and connect to other servers or systems in real time. Since servers,
  messaging systems, and marketing CRMs aren’t always integrated, webhooks allow
  marketers to keep up with user events and use all the data at their disposal
  to trigger messages and other actions. They function like an API but focus on
  immediately transferring information for specific actions.<br /><br />Webhooks
  can be used by marketers to ensure that key actions to occur seamlessly for
  the user. For example, if a user hits a milestone in a gaming app, the webhook
  associated with that milestone could ensure that their account is updated to
  place them in a higher ranking segment, or credit their account with a coupon.
  Webhooks can also be used to communicate with users on social media, via SMS,
  or through other third-party systems. Not all marketing automation platforms
  support webhooks, so you’ll want to consider including webhook support when
  putting together your RFP.

<p>\ˈweb\ \ˈme-sij-in\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Web messaging is a type of customer communication that reaches web viewers via
  their browser.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Web messaging is a type of brand-to-customer communication that makes it
  possible to reach people via web browser, whether on desktop or through the
  mobile web. By making it possible for marketers to engage, retain, and
  monetize their audience of web viewers, web messaging can help brands broaden
  their reach, support coordinated multichannel messaging across web and mobile,
  and strengthen their customer/brand relationships across the board.<br /><br />The
  two major forms of web messaging are web push notifications (also known as web
  push) and in-browser messages, which closely resemble mobile app push
  notifications and in-app messages, respectively. These messaging channels can
  be used to reach web visitors on both desktop and the mobile web, making them
  a versatile way to stay in touch with customers through their browser.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “I had no idea that web messaging was even a thing—until I got an in-browser
  message while I was shopping for shoes online.”

<h1 id="whitelabel">Whitelabel</h1>
<p>ˈwīt\ \ˈlā-bəl\</p>
<h2>TL:DR</h2>
<p>
  Whitelabeling masks various products you use, like mobile marketing automation
  platforms, so that it looks like users are receiving emails directly from your
  domain.
</p>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>
  Whitelabeling is the process of re-branding or masking a product so that it
  looks and feels like your site or domain. Of the more important forms,
  marketers can use whitelabeling to customize emails to your domain so they
  look to end-users like they are coming directly from you even if they are
  being sent through your CRM, ESP, or marketing platform vendor. Email
  whitelabeling is critical for reputation and deliverability as it vastly
  increases the likelihood users will engage with those emails and ISPs will be
  more likely to deliver them to the Inbox instead of spam.<br /><br />Rather
  than showing the email coming from Appboy or SendGrid, for example, users and
  their ISPs/mailbox providers will recognize your domain as the source.
  Whitelabeling is accomplished using your email marketing platform through the
  creation of sending subdomains and DNS records which your development team
  will add to your DNS system.
</p>
<h2>USED IN A SENTENCE</h2>
<p>
  “Our open and click rates really went up after we whitelabeled our domain—I
  guess our customers feel better about engaging if they know they message is
  from us.”
